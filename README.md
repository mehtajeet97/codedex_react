# About REACT

<p>In 2013, a JavaScript library was introduced to the world and changed the course of web dev forever. React is a JavaScript library used for building websites with reusable components. It lets you create a multi-page website and not have to update things repeatedly in different files.<p>

Some of React's most useful features include:

<ul>
<li>An interesting flavor of JavaScript called JSX.</li>
<li>An efficient way to update parts of your site.</li>
<li>It's fast and scalable!</li>
</ul>

<p> Hot reloading is a feature in React that allows developers to instantly see changes made to their code in real time. The output gets updated with every character we type in the code editor.</p>
<p>Before React, updating your website meant changing the same element in every file. With React, you change a single element in one place and that change applies everywhere!</p>

## Brief history

<p>Initially developed by a small team at Facebook for their Newsfeed feature, React was eventually open-sourced to the public in 2013. While still maintained by Facebook, React has grown a large following of open source contributors</p>

## React Syntax

<p> JSX is like "syntactic sugar" because it looks like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript! We can define JSX either in a .js file or a .jsx file. For this course, we're using .js files! When you run your code, JSX gets transpiled, or translated into plain JavaScript and then read by the browser.</p>

<p> Sometimes referred to as "JavaScript Syntax Extension", parts of JSX are disguised as HTML. When you run a React app, the HTML-like parts are transpiled into browser-readable JavaScript! JSX can also be written as a function that returns markup. JSX is only valid if everything is wrapped under a single element. This is the power of React that allows us to use a function to return our website's markup! </p>

## Building Blocks

<p> If JSX is like the "language" of React, then components are like the "building blocks" of the website's user interface. Components are defined like functions that return JSX content. <p>

## Attributes

<p> Just like with HTML, JSX supports attributes for applying cool settings to your content. Any valid HTML and their associated attributes are supported in JSXâ€¦mostly. For example: img tag with common attributes src and alt</p>

```
const selfie = <img src="username/camera/recents/today.png" alt="a selfie" />
```

<p>Unlike HTML, there are some important naming differences with JSX. One of the most widely used attributes in HTML is class. However, the JSX-equivalent to this is className. In JavaScript, "class" is actually a reserved keyword. Therefore, we use className! </p>
