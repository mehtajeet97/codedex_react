## About REACT

=================

<p>In 2013, a JavaScript library was introduced to the world and changed the course of web dev forever.</p>

<p>React is a JavaScript library used for building websites with reusable components. It lets you create a multi-page website and not have to update things repeatedly in different files.<p>

Some of React's most useful features include:

<ul>
<li>An interesting flavor of JavaScript called JSX.</li>
<li>An efficient way to update parts of your site.</li>
<li>It's fast and scalable!</li>
</ul>
<p>Before React, updating your website meant changing the same element in every file. With React, you change a single element in one place and that change applies everywhere!</p>

<p>Initially developed by a small team at Facebook for their Newsfeed feature, React was eventually open-sourced to the public in 2013. While still maintained by Facebook, React has grown a large following of open source contributors</p>
